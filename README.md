# Ethics manifesto 

## My Ethical Principles

- The credibility of data I think is one of the most important things to me. The reason for that is data can tell a powerful story and can lead to powerful decision making. However anyone can create a dataset full of fake or inflated numbers and sway an audience. With data that is being used it needs to be sourced and reliable. However just like in one of the previous readings that I enjoyed says "Data scientists don’t need a list of ways to be virtuous. They need a list of ways to prove they aren’t charlatans. That will do more to ensure the health and trustworthiness of the profession than anything else."

- The usage of data to oppress people. What I mean by this is related to the article we read on insurance premiums being priced higher based on demographics particularly race in certain locations. I find that very unethical in which everyone should be given same opportunities not based on race.

- How much privacy should we sacrifice to keep others and ourselves safe? That has been a question I have been wondering for sometime. As we read the article on the state that South Africa is in and how dangerous it can be and the implementation of images to identify crime/criminals was interesting. For me it is understandable to keep information or visuals on people who have been rated as criminals before or have multiple felonies. People who have committed felonies should be monitored.




## Reading Discussion


One of the main principles that I have learned about data is that companies or organizations both big and small deal with data. As stated from one of the previous articles we read "Big data are here to grow. The only way of tackling them is to know what you are or may be looking for." Many of them aren't too sure on what to do with the data, so us data scientists are there to take what data they have and tell a story with it and make powerful decisions.
